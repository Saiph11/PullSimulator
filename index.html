                        <h2>How does Genshin Impact Wish Work?</h2>
                        <p>In Genshin Impact, the Wish system is a gacha-style mechanic that allows players to obtain new characters and weapons by spending in-game currency. There are three main types of banners: the Character Event Wish, which features limited-time 5-star characters; the Weapon Event Wish, which offers powerful 5-star weapons; and the Standard Wish, a permanent banner with a mix of characters and weapons. To make a wish, players use either Intertwined Fates (for limited banners) or Acquaint Fates (for the standard banner), both of which can be purchased using Primogems, a currency earned through gameplay or bought with real money.

                            The system is governed by specific drop rates: a 0.6% chance for a 5-star item, 5.1% for a 4-star, and 94.3% for a 3-star. To balance the randomness, Genshin Impact includes a pity system. Players are guaranteed a 5-star item at 90 wishes (80 for weapons), and a 4-star or higher every 10 wishes. Additionally, the 50/50 rule applies to character banners—if a player pulls a 5-star character and it’s not the featured one, the next 5-star is guaranteed to be the featured character.</p>
